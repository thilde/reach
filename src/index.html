  At Reach Advertising Inc., our purpose is to provide outstanding internet-based advertising services to meet niche markets with leading-edge web design solutions.
  </p>
  <p>We opened our business in 2007 when we launched our first advertising web site called LemonLot.com. Our mission at that time was to help the military community buy and sell their vehicles. And it worked! A couple of years later, we made a strategic decision to broaden our approach with MilitaryCarLot.com and the results got even better. And now in 2014, we have a portfolio of web sites that are targeted to the U.S. military community to provide them the very best car buying services and information. We are applying our design solutions and branching out to local communities where we focus on developing unique sites that extend the reach of these small business.</p>
<p>We incorporated in February of 2011 as Reach Advertising Inc. The owner of Reach Advertising Inc is a 22-year Air Force retired veteran who is determined to help serve the needs of the U.S. military members and their families. He has formed an expert team of young, tech-savy, and passionate partners who share the vision to provide these advertising services with excellence.</p>
